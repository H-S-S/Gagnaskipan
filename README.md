Personal Python Projects

Best Pricing Shop:
Best pricing was a program that I was trying to make using Open-Cv were the thought is to scan 
recipt from the store and the app would read it in. The whole idea as a whole would to have an 
app that would handel all your acounting and such. Right now it is only a way to scan in recipts that works for certain lights. But it is not fully flushed out.

Shortest-Distance:
Shortest distance is a program that would be used by the post office to find the most efficent 
way of delivering pagages when they are spread out. It uses the Google maps API along with a 
sql-lite database aswell as TKinter for GUI.

DatabaseTK:
It was when I was developing the database for the Shortest-Distance and was learning about it.

FINAL:
Final is a project in mech we did when we built an autonomous greenhouse that would take care
of plants. It gives them water along with heats to the desired tempeture that the plant wants.
Other functionalities are such as using Adafruit IO and having a tempeture and humidity sensor
also a soil moisture sensor and a water level sensor also LED light that can be controlled.
Everything is controlled with a Rasbery Pi and a circut. 

Peerwise helper:
Peerwise helper is a GUI program that helped me select random pages from which I would write
questions about for mech. So I did not have to select them I could just enter the range of the 
chapters and I could select what chapters I wanted to write questions about and the program 
would select them for me.


I sould point out that I have made more programs but I most of them are not big programs and 
thus I did not want to put them in here.
